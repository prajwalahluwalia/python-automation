# python-automation

This repository documents my journey of building real-world Python automation tools that solve everyday problems — from messy folders and repetitive office tasks to reports, emails, and workflows.

Each project focuses on:

practical automation (not toy examples)

clean, readable Python code

safety-first execution (dry runs, logs, manifests)

explanations that are easy to follow

The goal is simple:
use Python to save time, reduce manual work, and make life easier.

All projects are open-source and documented so anyone can learn, reuse, or build on top of them.

You can read individual Readme.md for each project as well.


## OMEN — Organising Manual Entities Nicely

### Description:

A Python automation tool that organizes files in a folder based on their type.

OMEN scans a directory, categorizes files by extension, creates folders if needed, and moves files safely.

It includes dry-run support for safe previews, logging for transparency, and a manifest file to track changes.

Built to turn messy folders into clean, structured workspaces with minimal effort.
